-- Changing the model, there are no allowNull:False, instead validating form on the front-end


-- Use Session Storage so that we can break the form down 

-- Break Down the Application into Pieces 
-- Each part of the application exists as a seperate HTML page
-- When user Submits complete form, push data from sessionStorage to DB 
-- sessisonStorage keys/properties should mirror the DB properties
